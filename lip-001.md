## Simple Summary

Being a liberal, open and transparent community autonomy project, where everyone is free to propose, including technology, products, 
market as well as aesthetics, LibertySwap preaches emancipation from common worries.
Some good solutions or arguments can be shared through LIP. For instances, one protocol researcher can share his suggestion with other.
Nowadays, James has the exclusive right to propose and 60% of the voting rights would be allocated until new fans join. Of course,
the formulation of the voting model will occur when more liberal consensus members become the LIP adventures.


## Abstract

This LIP is the rule of the first proposal right. In addition, James, as the first participant, 
will be allocated 60% of the voting right. For other subsequent proposals, no matter product, 
design or LBT token mechanism, James still has 60% of the voting right but it is not the final result since the whole voting rights 
will be released to all project participants in the long term.


## Motivation

Being a geeky liberal, James loves the freedom, openness, decentralization as well as autonomy of blockchain. 
This is why James has decided to lauch LibertySwap where the proposal right of LIP is also free and belongs to everyone. 
 
About the early proposal and voting right, James will occupy 60% since LibertySwap need one original and unified model.
In spite of this, when community can offer strong vitality, the right will be released to all participants and LIP-100 proposal should announce the resolution.

## Specification

It is greatly normal that DAO governance has existed for long time since the early stage of blockchain as well as liberty swap.
Those of libertyswap technology, cultures, model and other ideas will be announced in the form of proposals from now on. What’s more,
while James possesses 60% of the voting rights, everyone can not only make suggestions, comments or other here, but also receive the corresponding LBT token bonus.

## Rationale

James provides direct access and discretion on early proposals.
Also, the implementation of this standard would promote LibertySwap better and make communities more attractive.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP is fully backwards compatible.
