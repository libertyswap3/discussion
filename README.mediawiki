1.Declaration of Independence

Being a geeky liberal, I love the freedom, openness, decentralization as well as autonomy of blockchain.  
This is why I have decided to launch my own project where everyone is free to trade, mine and collect assets. 
Emancipation from common worries is what I preach. 
Whoever does not agree should not waste the time of myself, others or the common goal.
